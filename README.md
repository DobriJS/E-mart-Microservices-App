### !! You should be familiar with Docker concepts and containerization also in order to run the project !!

### Steps

1. run from the terminal `docker-compose build`
2. after the process of building images run `docker-compose up -d`
3. based on that where you run the app, local or on the cloud, type in the browser ex. `http:\\localhost:80`
4. run `docker-compose down` to clean up the containers
